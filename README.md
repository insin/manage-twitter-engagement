# Manage Twitter Engagement

![](icons/icon128.png)

**Manage "engagement" on Twitter by moving retweets and algorithmic tweets to their own lists**

Retweets and algorithmic timeline tweets on Twitter bring tension and emotion to a scene that already has too much of both.

Manage Twitter Engagement moves them to their own lists on the homepage to reduce the default amount of "engagement" on Twitter, allowing you to opt-in to extra tweets when you have the headspace for them, instead of mixing them all together in your feed.
